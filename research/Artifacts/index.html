<p>Most development projects over time evolve from a simple, understandable
collection of artifacts, tools, and the way they relate to each other
into a complex, incomprehensible compound of artifacts, tools, and developers
who work with them.
The following figure illustrates this evolution with a simple set of tools and the
artifacts they produce and edit. The arrows between the tools and artifacts
represent the relations.</p>

<p>Especially, developing modern software solutions has become an increasingly complex
and time consuming process. As both the requirements and expectations towards modern
software increase, the need for the development of increasingly large and
complex systems arises. In general, the larger the developed system needs to be
the more developers will be involved in the creation process in order to finish
the project in an acceptable timespan
<a href="#BGRW17">[BGRW17]</a>.
Often problems arise when large groups of people have to cooperate on the same
project over a longer period of time. For example, architectural decisions made
years ago, might be difficult to understand once the responsible architect moved
on to the next project. But even if the original contributors of the project are
present the complexity of large software systems often becomes overwhelming to a
point where people can easily lose track of relevant structures, artifacts, and
their relations.</p>

<p>A good example is Model-driven development (MDD). As a prominent enabler for the
automatic generation of programming language files for products or for tests
from explicitly defined models, MDD projects manage a large magnitude of
artifacts (files, etc.) with various relationships. A large class of artifact
relations comes from artifacts using others, e.g., via importing types and
signatures. This form of usage strongly differs from generation dependencies,
where one artifact is generated, compiled, and transformed from or to other
artifacts
<a href="#BGRW18">[BGRW18]</a>.
An MDD project usually entails a number of potentially dependent process steps,
where a chain of generating, compiling and packaging artifacts arises.
During these steps a multitude of artifacts are created, read or even executed.
Those artifacts are thus related to each other in various ways. The number and
complexity of occurring dependencies and other relationships between development
artifacts can lead to several problems, such as poor maintainability and long
development times of both, MDD tools and the product, in an MDD process. To
tackle these problems, it is important to understand which artifacts are
involved and how these artifacts are related to each other in MDD projects.</p>

<p>Leaving the domain of software development and entering the domain of cyber
physical systems (CPS) engineering the problem of complex project structures
becomes even more pressing
<a href="#BHR+18">[BHR+18]</a>.
Here, development projects have a much wider range. Now, not only the relations
of processes, structures, and artifacts of one single domain, for instance
mechanical engineering, need to be understood but their relations within and
between several domains. At the core is the problem of undocumented knowledge of
project, process, and artifact structures. Somehow somebody knows what to do at
a certain point in time of a project. It is known that artifacts of a certain
type always can be found at a specific place (on a file system, database, etc.).
It is also known that once artifacts of this type are modified, other artifacts,
processes or departments might be affected by the change. A first step of
dealing with this problem is making the implicit knowledge explicit. This step,
however, needs a precisely defined methodology which provides modeling languages
and techniques.</p>

<p>The previous figure shows how to handle the complexity of model-driven systems
engineering projects with artifact models. Furthermore, it shows the relations
between the involved stakeholders and the artifact model, as well as, the
artifact data. An architect creates the artifact model for a systems engineering
project shown on the left side of the figure. Its goal is to structure all the
different kinds of artifacts and their relations within the project created by
people involved in it, represented by the developer icon shown on the right
side of the figure. Corresponding to the artifact model, artifact data is
extracted from the project. This data contains information about all artifacts
and their relations of the project in its current state. Analysts, shown on
the right side of the figure, use this data to check the current state of a
project. Additionally, the artifact data can be used as input for software
tools for further processing.</p>

<h2 id="modeling-artifacts-and-their-relations">Modeling artifacts and their relations</h2>

<p>At this chair we developed a methodology providing modeling techniques and
corresponding tooling which help to understand artifacts in complex development
structures
<a href="#GHR17">[GHR17]</a>.
We provide a way to define a custom artifact model for a project, department or
a company which describes artifacts and their relations. Additionally, we
provide a customizable tool-chain which extracts artifact information and
performs analyses on this artifact data. This data then can be further used by
analysts or software tools to help understand, analyze, and improve complex
development projects
<a href="#Gre19">[Gre19]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-architectures-substructures--erosion">Understanding architectures, substructures &amp; erosion</h2>

<p>One example for an analysis based on the artifacts and their relations is
understanding architectures and substructures of development projects, as well
as, analyzing the architectural erosion occurring over time. We used our
modeling techniques to create tooling which analyzes and calculates the
architectural drift based on the project’s artifacts and their relation. Once an
architect defines the concept architecture of a project, the current
architecture can be automatically check with respect to the concept.</p>

<p>The last figure illustrates the results of such a calculation of the architectural
drift. After creating the artifact model for the project, a tool-chain
automatically extracts the artifact data of the project in its current state.
Additionally, an architect defines which modules exists in the project and which
relations between them exists (illustrated by the boxes and arrows). A module in
this case is a conceptual container for artifacts which does not need to
correspond to any file structure within the project. The architect also adds
information to the relations between the modules by declaring which relations
must exists and which are not allowed illustrated by the arrows’ coloring and
icons. Hence, he defines the concept architecture of the project. This
architecture is then used to calculate the architectural drift of the the
current architecture, meaning the current relations between the modules,
reconstructed from the artifact data of the project. The icons on the arrows
indicate which relations between modules must exist (green check) and which are
forbidden (red cross). The arrows represent relations between modules. The
coloring of the arrows illustrates if the constraints defined by the icons
whether a constraint is stratified. As an example, a red arrow with a red cross
from module A to module B means that any relations between artifacts contained
in module A to artifacts in module B are forbidden, however, in the current
architecture this is not the case. Moreover, dashed arrows indicate relations
between modules which are not modeled by the architect.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-project-structures--tooling">Understanding project structures &amp; tooling</h2>

<p>Moving away from the artifact layer, we applied our methodology for modeling
artifacts and their relations within complex projects to tools and their
relation. In a first prototype we analyzed the structure and relations of
repositories, CI/CD, and documentation tooling in an overlapping fashion. This
way, we were able to understand artifacts and their relation within the tools,
but also across them, giving us the opportunity to create an overview of our
project and further analyze it.</p>

<p>The figure demonstrates our attempt to leave the layer of a file system to perform
artifact-based analyses and move to the layer of tools and their relations
within a project. Based on an artifact model created to understand artifacts
which are primarily located on the level of a file system, we added the
information of different tools and their relations to the model. In the figure
these are the wiki (green), bugtacker (purple), jenkins build server (red), and
git repositories (blue). The figure shows an overview of all these tools which
are part of our own MontiCore project. By using the concept of artifact-based
analyses, we are able to better understand not only the artifacts and their
relations within a project, but also the type of tools which are involved and
the artifacts they work with.</p>

<h2 id="key-statements">Key Statements</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Modeling artifacts and their relations tackles two problems of complex
development systems:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Making implicit knowledge about process, structures, and artifacts explicit,
as well as,</li>
  <li>enabling analyses of the artifact data to understand and improve projects.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>This is even more beneficial once the domain of CPS development is entered
and projects span across multiple departments and a multitude of tools <a href="#HJK+21">[HJK+21]</a>.</li>
  <li>We have developed a methodology providing modeling techniques to help
understand artifacts and their relations in complex development projects.
Furthermore, we created a customizable tool-chain which enables automated
extraction and analyses of artifact data of model-driven systems engineering
projects.</li>
</ol>
