### Working Group

Modern vehicle systems highly depend on software distributed over multiple electrical control units and highly 
intertwined with the underlying hardware and mechanics. The tasks of this software range from vehicular core functionality 
such as engine or battery control to automated driver assistance and infotainment systems. The frontiers of this exciting 
field are being pushed daily towards fully autonomous intelligent driving systems. As the Automotive Software Engineering 
group we work closely with the automotive industry analyzing challenges in automotive software development processes, languages, 
and tools. Our mission is to research and deliver software development methodologies able to handle the complexity and 
heterogeneity of future cyber-physical transportation systems and to make it easier for automotive engineers to implement, 
test, and verify maintainable and extensible solutions. To achieve this goal our research is based on the following pillars:

- software development processes in engineering domains
- domain specific languages
- generative software engineering and testing
- simulation
- deep learning and data science.
