### Working Group

Informatics as a research discipline must constantly face new challenges such
as heterogeneous information sources, growing amounts of structural and
behavioural data, and broad range of possible end-users. Thus, the need for
(a) assistive and (b) information services and systems grows. We meet these
challenges by using models and model-based software engineering as foundation
to develop data-centric information systems and assistive systems.


<h5 style="font-weight: bold"> Model-Based Software Engineering </h5>

Generating software is an important capability for a tooling
infrastructure that successfully assists modeling in the development
process (see ["Agile Model Based Software Engineering"](../research/Agile-MBSE)). As
every application domain has its own terms, relations, structure
and behaviour, there is a need for developing different [Domain
Specific Languages (DSLs)](../research/Domain-Specific-Languages)
for each domain and/or purpose. The automatic
combination of models from a variety of DSLs ensures consistency
(e.g. for front- and backend).

<h5 style="font-weight: bold"> Data-Centric Information Systems and Services </h5>

Systems and services for the representation of big amounts of data such
as web-information portals are commonly used and their representation and
system architecture highly depends on the domain in focus. Using generative
methods accelerates the development process (see ["Generative
Software Engineering"](../research/Generative-SE)) and decreases development time, as changes of the
models are easily passed on to the source code. We are demonstrating the
practical application of this approach , e.g., in the [MaCoCo](../projects/MaCoCo) and InviDas
project using the generator framework MontiGem.

<h5 style="font-weight: bold"> Human-Centered Assistance Systems and Services </h5>

A step further from informing users is to provide support to them.
Supportive or also called assistive systems and services support human
processes both, at work and in private life. It is again an emerging research
field regarding the digital transformation of numerous application areas.
Such assistance services are commonly embedded in a larger system architecture
combining devices and resources, receiving data from sensors and communicate
with functions and services. Model-based approaches improve the communication
capabilities of these components and ensure consistency. Formal verification
methods can be applied to a safety-critical subset of these components and
their communication. Moreover, model-based approaches can be used to support
privacy-by-design and eases human-centered development approaches.

<h5 style="font-weight: bold"> Application Domains </h5>

Assistance and Information Services are relevant in a variety of domains.
Each of them with its own specifications, ideas and legal restrictions.
Thus, it is important to strongly involve domain experts into the development
process of such systems and services. This involvement can be supported by
using MBSE: Prototypes and functionalities can be developed fast, changes
can be easily handled, end users can provide feedback in an earlier development
stage and feature requests can be implemented faster.

The group members already have experiences in the following domains:

- Ambient Assisted Living
- Controlling and Finances
- Energy
- Health
- Internet of Production (IoP)
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Industry 4.0
- Smart Homes
