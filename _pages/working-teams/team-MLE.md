### Working Group

<img src="../../assets/img/mle-logo.png" alt="mdse-logo" style="float: right; height: 100px;">

Model-driven engineering reduces the conceptual gap between the problem domains 
(such as navigation, grasping, or business process description) and the solution domains 
(programming). Modeling languages enables domain experts to describe solutions without 
facing the accidental complexities and idiosyncrasies of programming languages. For developing 
tailored domain-specific modeling languages, a well-suited and tailored language workbench is 
necessary. [MontiCore](https://monticore.github.io/monticore/) is the language workbench we developed over the last years. We constantly 
extend and improve MontiCore to explore new ways for developing modeling languages and tools such 
as language composition or derivation. Besides improving languages workbenches and their development,
methodologies, guidelines and pattern for modeling language engineering are essential to facilitate 
language engineering and improve the resulting modeling languages.

### Research Questions

- Which features or concepts need to be provided by a language workbench to facilitate modeling language engineering? Which reusable languages or language components are essential and how to modularize these to optimize their reuse capabilities?
- Besides typical model processing infrastructure such as parser or well-formedness checkers, which tooling such as transformation or semantic differencing capabilities facilitate model-driven engineering?
- What are the software languages required for efficient systems engineering with domain experts? How are software languages engineered, integrated, and reused? How does this translate to modeling tools, synthesis, analyses, transformations, and code generators?
- How can we leverage language derivation to facilitate the development of supporting languages such as transformation, variability or tagging languages?
