## Agile Data Development

In cooperation with the WZL, MSE and Bewind as industrial partner, the 
goal of this project is to develop a guideline in the sense of a 
procedure description for the implementation of an agile development 
process by integrating agile and plan-driven methods as well as their 
data-based support. Thus the project aims at (1) an increase of 
effectiveness by a targeted addressing of requirements in the sense of 
the agile idea shall be achieved, (2) an improvement of efficiency by 
avoiding unwanted iterations due to improved data transparency shall be 
supported, (3) a data-based decision support by an integrated data and 
system architecture shall be enabled and (4) a reduction of 
time-to-market with a simultaneous increase of market. 

This approach is thus intended to increase the overall profitability of 
the windmill portfolio in the medium to long term. In addition, the 
approach focuses on efficiency gains in the development of new plants 
as well as improvements in the costs of parts, components and modules 
used across projects. Sub-goals of this project are: 

- Integration of agile and plan-driven development methods in the 
development of mechatronic systems in the context of the wind energy 
industry. 

- Real-time, data-based development of new product variants, 
considering volatile market and customer requirements. 

- Targeted, efficient realization of volatile and uncertain market 
requirements. 

- Creation of transparency through a linked, providing cross-company of 
development-relevant data. 

- Dynamic design of requirements management across the entire 
development process and adaptation of the development process, the 
development tools, and the downstream validation and certification 
strategy.

## AutoKnigge

AutoKnigge is a subproject of the second phase of the DFG SPP1835 
program on the research of interactively cooperating vehicles. The 
focus of the first phase, in the predecessor project RapidCoop, was on 
the concept of local traffic systems (LTS), which are ad-hoc networks 
for vehicular cooperation, and an architecture-centric, dynamic 
modeling methodology for the design of such systems. In AutoKnigge, a 
dynamic framework specifying vehicle behavior is to be developed. The 
vehicles ought to be able to select appropriate behavioral patterns 
based on a situation and hence, to perform corresponding cooperative 
manouvers. Furthermore a set of behavioral rules is to be defined which 
serves as a guidelines catalogue for cooperative vehicles.

## BEST Energy

[BEST Energy](http://www.bestenergyproject.eu/) is a project to improve 
the energy efficiency in buildings, which project belongs to the ICT 
Policy Support Programme. The main objective of this project was to 
improve the energy efficiency in public buildings and street public 
lighting, by the ICT-based centralized monitoring and management of the 
energy consumption and production, and to provide decision makers with 
the necessary tools to be able to plan energy saving measures. To 
achieve this objective BEST Energy project did implement and validate 
four pilots, two related to energy efficiency in public buildings (one 
in a Sports centre in Spain and one in a University building in 
Germany), and another two regarding energy efficiency in public street 
lighting. The pilots implement innovative advanced control mechanisms 
allowing to substantially improve the energy efficiency in the 
respective buildings and spaces. 

The [Synavision GmbH](https://www.synavision.de/) is an offspring of 
these activities.

## The CarOLO Project on Autonomous Driving

In the context of the CarOLO project, we developed Caroline already at 
the TU Braunschweig. Caroline is a fully autonomous car, which allowed 
us to take part in the Darpa Urban Challenge. Caroline managed to win 
7th place, was the best newcomer in the competition and our chair 
became the best non-american team (see also [Darpa Grand 
Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_(2007))).

## Collaborative Embedded Systems (CrESt)

In the [CrESt](https://crest.in.tum.de/) research project, 23 partners 
from industry and research investigated how to reliably engineer the 
software of the future's smart, distributed CPS. We investigated 
modeling techniques, methods, and processes to manage the complexity of 
engineering software for dynamically coupled, automated CPS. Our main 
contributions focus on tool integration and artifact-based analysis, 
language variability, and evolution of software product line 
architectures. The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry 
for Education and Research (BMBF).

## EmbeddedMontiArc

EmbeddedMontiArc is an architecture-centric component-based modeling 
methodology focusing on automotive software and cyber-physical systems 
engineering. Its elaborate type system supporting SI units, a math 
oriented behaviour description language, as well as compact syntax for 
the instantiation and interconnection of large systems enables 
developers to focus on functionality rather than on annoying technical 
details. The EmbeddedMontiArc compiler produces high-performance 
executable code and generates interfaces to middleware solutions such 
as ROS. What's more, EmbeddedMontiArcDL supports the design of 
intelligent systems by providing a dedicated and easy-to-learn neural 
network modeling and training language. The models can be executed and 
validated in MontiSim, our distributed and service-oriented simulator 
for autonomous, interactively collaborative vehicles.

## Intelligente modulare Serviceroboter-Funktionalitäten im menschlichen Umfeld am Beispiel von Krankenhäusern (iserveU)

In [iserveU](http://www.se-rwth.de/materials/iserveu/), we explore 
model-driven engineering methods for service robotics applications in 
dynamic environments with a consortium of three companies and four 
universities. We develop a family of integrated 
[MontiCore](http://www.monticore.de/) modeling languages to describe, 
plan, and execute robotics tasks without in-depth programming 
expertise. Models of these languages are used by a 
[MontiArc](http://www.monticore.de/) software architecture which 
integrated robotics middlewares to, ultimately, operate service robots 
in a German hospital. The project is funded by the [German Federal 
Ministry for Education and Research 
(BMBF)](http://www.softwaresysteme.pt-dlr.de/de/forschungsvorhaben-servicerobotik.php).

## Interaktive, visuelle Datenräume zur souveränen, datenschutzrechtlichen Entscheidungsfindung (InviDas)

Many people are increasingly surrounded by digital technologies and 
applications that collect, process and share personal data. At the same 
time, few read and understand the often long and complicated privacy 
statements of their individual devices and applications. Within the 
InviDas project, we ensure that users of smart wearables, such as 
fitness watches, will in future have better insight into their data 
profiles and will thus be able to make informed decisions more easily. 
New forms of data visualization and gamification are being researched, 
with which both manufacturers and users can make data privacy 
declarations more comprehensible and transparent. 

The project is funded by the 
[BMBF](https://www.technik-zum-menschen-bringen.de/projekte/invidas). 

The InviDas project is jointly realized by the [Gesellschaft für 
Informatik e.V.](https://gi.de/), Stiftung Digitale Chancen, Garmin 
Würzburg GmbH, RWTH Aachen University ([Software 
Engineering](https://www.se-rwth.de/), [Chair and Institute of 
Industrial Engineering and Ergonomics](https://www.iaw-aachen.de/) and 
[Applied Ethics](https://www.ethics.rwth-aachen.de/)), Universität 
Bremen and Otto-Friedrich Universität Bamberg.

## Internet of Production (IoP)

The Internet – in its meaning of a worldwide socio-technical network – 
has revolutionized accessibility of data and knowledge. This idea has 
been transferred to the physical world with the concept of the Internet 
of Things (IoT). A direct application of the IoT approach to production 
is currently not sufficiently feasible. There are many more parameters 
but much less available data than other big data application domains. 
Vast amounts of data characterize modern production. However, this data 
is neither easily accessible, interpretable, nor connected to gain 
knowledge. With the [Internet of Production 
(IoP)](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bktz), we have the vision to 
enable a new level of cross-domain collaboration by providing 
semantically adequate and context-aware data from production, 
development, and usage in real-time on an appropriate level of 
granularity. The central scientific approach is the introduction of 
Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. The Cluster of Excellence will 
design and implement a conceptual reference infrastructure for the 
Internet of Production that enables the generation and application of 
Digital Shadows. The vision of IoP is to enable a new level of 
cross-domain collaboration by providing semantically adequate and 
context-aware data from production, development, and usage in 
real-time, on an adequate level of granularity.

## Management Cockpit for University Chair Controlling (MaCoCo)

Within the [MaCoCo (Management Cockpit for 
Controlling)](/projects/MaCoCo) project we 
realize a multi-user web-application for the decentralized management 
and controlling of organizational processes within the chairs or 
institutes of a university. The key elements of the project focus on 
finance, staff and project organization. 

Large parts of the code are generated with the [MontiCore language 
workbench and code generation 
framework](https://se-rwth.github.io/topics/MontiCore/) to ensure a 
highly adaptable system. Lead users are involved actively in the 
development process to be able to provide a useful solution. 

The MaCoCo project is funded by the RWTH Aachen University and jointly 
realized by the chairs of Controlling and Software Engineering.

## Modelling Solution for Complex Software Systems (ModelPlex)

The three major objectives of 
[ModelPlex](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/79760_en.html) are to 
develop an open solution for complex systems engineering improving 
quality and productivity, lead its industrialisation and ensure its 
successful adoption by the industry.

## MontiBelle - Intelligent Verification

Based on a well-estabilished mathematical dataflow-theory, we apply 
logic, knowledge representation and intelligent reasoning to software 
engineering to perform correctness proofs, execute symbolic tests or 
find counterexamples. The theorem prover Isabelle is a mature and 
fundamental tool, which allows to represent knowledge as a collection 
of definitions and theorems and reason about systems. To increase the 
usability we provide a high-level API encapsulating the low-level logic 
engine as well as a domain-specific modeling language as front end 
coupled with an Isabelle code generator.

These and the rapid increase of computation capabilities suggest that a 
prominent application for reducing certification costs of critical 
systems such as intelligent flight control systems or assistance 
systems for air or road traffic management is not far in the future.

## The MontiCore Language Workbench

MontiCore is a language workbench for an efficient development of 
domain-specific languages (DSLs). It processes an extended grammar 
format which defines the DSL and generates Java components for 
processing the DSL documents. Examples for these components are parser, 
AST classes, symboltables or visitors. This enables a user to rapidly 
define a language and use it together with the MontiCore-framework to 
build domain specific tools. Some MontiCore advantages are the 
reusability of predefined language components, conservative extension 
and composition mechanisms and an optimal integration of hand-written 
code into the generated tools. MontiCore enables the research of 
model-based software development methods employing a variety of DSLs 
and modeling languages. On top of this, MontiCore and its DSL products 
are successfully in use in academic and industrial research projects in 
various domains such as automotive software modeling, cloud 
architecture and security modeling, model-based robotics, smart energy 
management, neural network modeling. The design rationale of MontiCore 
is to provide a powerful and efficient workbench for the agile creation 
of DSLs along with their accompanying infrastructure such as analyses, 
transformations, and code generators. 

#### MontiCore features:

- Combined specification of concrete and abstract syntax in a 
context-free grammar 

- Customizable generation of parser and abstract syntax tree

- Generation of analysis infrastructure including visitors

- Adaptable grammar processing via interpreted Groovy scripts

- Configurable logging and process reporting

- Freemarker Template Engine for easy code generation

#### DSLs created with MontiCore:

- Unified Modeling Language for Programming (UML/P)

- MontiArc Architecture Description Language (ADL) and languages based 
on it such as 
  - MontiArcAutomaton - ADL with automaton behavior specification
  - clArc - Cloud ADL Family
  - MontiSecArc - ADL with security constraints
  - EmbeddedMontiArc - ADL for automotive software and cyber-physical 
    systems engineering

- Aerospace Constraint Specification Language - DSL for the 
specification of significant air traffic scenarios 

- MontiTrans - Generator and Infrastructure for domain-specific 
transformation languages 

- GUIDSL - DSL to describe the layout of websites

- A language to model restrictions in television broadcasts

- Java, Class Diagrams, Feature Diagrams, JSON, XML, OCL/P, Object 
Diagrams, Statecharts, and [many 
more](http://www.monticore.de/languages) 

There are many publications about MontiCore (see e.g. 
[here](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/)). Especially the 
[MontiCore Handbook](http://monticore.de/handbook.pdf) contains a good 
summary of how to use [MontiCore](http://monticore.de/).

## MontiCore-based Generator framework for Enterprise Management (MontiGem)

The MontiGem framework allows developers to generate large parts of a 
web application for a domain specific Enterprise Information System 
based on the input models and provides a runtime environment for such 
systems. 

The generated parts include:

- Database schema

- Persistence layer - communication interface between application 
back-end and the database 

- Command infrastructure - communication interface between application 
front-end and back-end of the application as well as between parts of 
the back-end 

- Graphical user interface

## A Semantic Approach to Evolution Analysis in Model-Based Software Development (Semantic Diff)

The semantic difference from one model to another model contains the 
elements in the semantics of the former model that are no elements in 
the semantics of the latter model. Revealing the semantic differences 
from one model version to a successor model version facilitates to 
understand the semantic impact of the syntactic changes that have been 
applied to the original model version to obtain the successor model 
version. In this project, we develop 

- semantic differencing methods for various concrete modeling languages and

- concrete modeling language-independent methods that facilitate 
solving semantic model evolution analysis problems.

## SensorCloud, a BMBF Trusted Cloud Computing project

In Cloud Computing the user no longer owns all the devices which 
process personal data. To lower scepticism, the project SensorCloud 
investigates techniques to understand and compensate all adoption 
barriers in a scenario consisting of cloud applications that utilize 
sensors and actuators in private places. This project adresse the 
interdisciplinary, i.e. social and technical research challenges for 
the trustworthy integration of sensor and actuator devices with the 
Cloud Computing paradigm. Most importantly, these challenges include 
ease of development, security and privacy, and social dimensions of a 
cloud-based system which integrates into private life.

## SysML Workbench for the SPES Method (SpesML)

The [Systems Modeling Language 
(SysML)](https://www.omgsysml.org/SysML-2.htm) is extensively used in 
practice as a modeling language by tool vendors and standardization 
organizations such as the OMG. The industrial introduction of 
model-based system engineering (MBSE) often consists only of using the 
SysML modeling language and simple drawing tools, without an 
appropriate semantic concept and a consistent development methodology. 
Existing, more advanced methods and tools are not directly applicable. 
Thus, the essential potentials of the methodology of integrated MBSE 
are not used. SPES provides a semantically based concept for MBSE with 
a set of methods. 

This project aims to develop a SysML workbench for the SPES methodology 
and make it available for practical use. This workbench will support 
the SPES methods and models continuously to ensure the dissemination of 
MBSE, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, the 
widely used modeling language SysML will be semantically and 
methodically substantiated and will pave the way to a comprehensive 
MBSE approach, especially for industry.
