Software engineeraing is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, 
operation, and maintenance of software. Consequently, research in software engineering investigates software requirements, 
design, construction, testing, maintenance, quality, and development processes as well ast its mathematical foundations. Moreover, 
it is intrinsically multi-disciplinary and applied to a great variety of different fields.

## Foundations of Model-Based Software Engineering

At the Chair of Software Engineering, we organize expertise in the different aspects and application fields of software 
engineering in teams to foster efficient research and development. Currently, these teams are:
- [Automotive and Cyber-Physical Systems (ASE)](/working-teams/team-ASE)
- [Model-Based Assistance and Information Services (MBAIS)](/working-teams/team-MBAIS)
- [Model-Driven Systems Engineering (MDSE)](/working-teams/team-MDSE)
- [Modeling Language Engineering (MLE)](/working-teams/team-MLE)
