We'd like to invite you to dive into the activities of our group. 
and some of their organizational and digital outcomes
Of course our [publications](/publications) are the most interesting
results (and thus presented separately). 
The links collected below present 
interesting and helpful information. Occasionally news are 
published via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SE_RWTH) and

## Some Open Source Software

- [Language Workbench MontiCore Official 
  Website](https://monticore.github.io/monticore/)

  </a>
  Starting in 2004, the 
  language workbench MontiCore has been developed by the SE Group. 
  Throughout the development process, the results of the latest research 
  have been incorporated into the project. Of course, the newest 
  insights are continuously integrated.

- [The SSElab Portfolio of SE Services](https://sselab.de/lab1/) - 
  SSElab is comprising a set of services, such as git, subversion, 
  issue tracking, code generation facilities, wikis, storage, 
  web-space, mailing services, web-based feedback, ppt2eps, and 
  numerous others. It is open for general use and in use by our 
  own development projects since 2007.

- [Autonomous Driving Car Caroline at the DARPA Urban 
  Challenge](https://www.christianberger.net/)  - The research 
  project was focused on analyzing, designing, implementing, and 
  evaluating a complex distributed system to realize autonomous 
  driving for urban-like scenarios. The vehicle "Caroline" 
  demonstrated its abilities by successfully participating in 
  the [DARPA Urban Challenge 
  2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_(2007)).

- [Delta-Simulink](https://github.com/RumpeIT/delta-simulink) 
  is an extension for simulink to model variability using delta 
  modelling. It constructs variants of Simulink models from a base 
  model and a selected set of deltas (aka features).

- [NESTML - Modelling Neuronal Cells of the Human 
  Brain](https://github.com/nest/nestml) - NestML is a domain 
  specific language that supports the specification of neuron models 
  in a precise and concise syntax. Model equations can e.g. be given 
  as an algorithm written in the built-in mathematical language. The 
  differential equations are analyzed by NESTML to compute an exact 
  solution if possible or handled by an appropriate numeric solver 
  otherwise. Among others NESTML provides SI units, like "km/h" or "As".

- [MontiSecArc (MSA)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/MontiSecArc) 
  is a Security Architecture Description Language. This repository 
  contains tooling based on MontiCore for Security Architecture Analysis 
  and development of generators to derive code from MSA models.

- [SE Commons](https://github.com/MontiCore/se-commons) is a 
  collection of smaller utilities and tools.

## Latest Books

(see also [Books of RWTH Software Engineering Group](/books))

- [[HKR21] K. Hölldobler, O. Kautz, B. Rumpe: 
  MontiCore Language Workbench and Library Handbook: Edition 2021. 
  Aachener Informatik-Berichte, Software Engineering Band 48. 
  ISBN 978-3-8440-8010-0. Shaker Verlag, 
  May 2021.](https://monticore.de/download/handbook.pdf/) 
  <a href="https://monticore.de/download/handbook.pdf/"><img 
  src="../../assets/img/handbook2021.gif" alt="MontiCore HandBook" 
  style="height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;"></a> 
  This book describes the MontiCore workbench developed since 2004. 
  It contains conceptual insights into language composition, refinement, 
  extension and potential techniques to preserve language properties 
  conservatively, but also concentrates on the technical realisation 
  and use of the MontiCore workbench.

- [SoSyM: Springer International Journal on Software And Systems 
  Modelling](https://www.sosym.org/) <a href="https://www.sosym.org/">
  <img src="../../assets/img/sosym1.jpeg" alt="MontiCore HandBook" 
  style="height: 55px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;"></a> 
  In 2001, Robert France and Prof. Rumpe founded the SoSym-Journal. 
  Nowadays, it is the primary venue for articles about modelling, 
  modelling languages and related issues in software and systems 
  development.

- [[CFJ+16] B. Combemale, R. France, J. Jézéquel, B. Rumpe, J. Steel, 
    D. Vojtisek: Engineering Modeling Languages: Turning Domain Knowledge 
    into Tools. Chapman & Hall/CRC Innovations in Software Engineering and  
    Software Development Series, November 2016.](http://mdebook.irisa.fr/) 
    <a href="http://mdebook.irisa.fr/">

    alt="MontiCore HandBook" 
    style="height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;"></a> 
    The book contains our view on how to design software languages 
    consolidating our longtime experience gained through longtime 
    research and within many industry projects. Technological progress 
    requires languages that allow to build models for inter-human 
    communication as well as human-computer-interaction. The companion 
    website provides the complete sources of various examples of the 
    book, and solutions to the exercises as well as other additional 
    material.

  The two books describe our interpretation on how to use the UML and 
  what concepts should be enhanced. Both are available in English or 
  German and provide lots of supplemental material.
