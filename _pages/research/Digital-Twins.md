## Summary of Most Relevant Topic Papers

There exists a plethora of definitions for Digital Twins (DTs),
however, there is little consensus about what a DT actually is.
The main weaknesses about the available definitions are that they are:
1) ambiguous, by deferring to another undefined term, such as a  "virtual
   representation",  "a virtual projection of the industrial facility into 
   the cloud", or a  "computable virtual abstraction";
2) narrow, by focusing on specific use cases, domains, or technologies, such
   as a  "digital model of the real network environment";  "product avatar"
   which includes only the product perspective and not machines, processes, 
   or material; or a  "virtual representation based on AR-technology";
3) underspecified, where a digital twin is mainly defined via its 
   automatic data flow from virtual to physical object but 
   falls short on discussing the role of models and additional information, 
   characteristics, and functionalities a digital twin has over its physical 
   object; or
4) utopian, due to all-encompassing aspirations, such as an "integrated 
   virtual model of a real-world system containing all of its physical 
   information", or a "complete digital representation".

As none of these definitions fit, researchers in the German cluster of 
Excellence "Internet of Production" [[BDJ+22]](#BDJ+22), 
which involves about 200 participating 
researchers from more than 30 co-located institutes from different disciplines, 
such as engineering, material science, computer science, economics, 
and social sciences, and more than 50 industrial partners, 
have come up with the following definition:

A **digital twin** [[DMR+20]](#DMR+20) of a system consists of
* a set of **models** of the system,
* a set of **digital shadows**, and
* provides a set of **services** to use the data and models purposefully 
with respect to the original system.

To be able to create a digital twin requires that we have observable elements 
in the physical world that can be monitored, sensed, or actuated and 
controlled.

The *set of models* helps to understand the system in the physical
world, e.g., structure, behavior, physical, geometrical or mathematical models.
These models can be, e.g., used to create the digital twin or to compare the 
current status of the twin with planned states.

Each **digital shadow** [[BBD+21b]](#BBD+21b) in this  *set of digital shadows* includes
* a set of contextual data-traces and/or their aggregation and abstraction 
collected concerning a system for a specific purpose with respect to the 
original system.

Within [[BBD+21b]](#BBD+21b), we present a conceptual model, 
give details on each concept
and provide an example from the production domain.
Following this definition, a digital shadow is
a passive set of data [[BDJ+22]](#BDJ+22) which is an information source about
a system's state and history.
The shadows are collected, filtered, and reduced for their purpose in
varying forms of abstractions and are purely digital artifacts produced by a 
(physical) system.
We can use, e.g., process mining algorithms for aggregating digital shadows 
from observed data [[BDJ+22]](#BDJ+22).
Moreover, shadows may contain information from different perspectives, e.g., 
systems (physical and organizations), processes, products, and humans.

The provided *services* during runtime of the digital twin
might include process mining, artificial intelligence, simulation
and predictive control services.
Process mining techniques can be used within \dts as services to further 
improve and adapt the used knowledge.
Artificial intelligence services help to realize real-time decisions and 
explainable AI within decision support helps to reduce human errors in 
decision making [[BPVZP19]](#BPVZP19).
Services to control the physical object need to send execution commands 
via APIs to the physical object and are often related to 
self-adaptiveness [[BBD+21a]](#BBD+21a).


To visualize relevant information, an interface for domain experts is needed,
which leads us to the term 
 **digital twin cockpit** [[BMRW22]](#BMRW22).  
* A digital twin cockpit is the user interaction part (UI/GUI) of a 
digital twin.
* It provides the graphical user interface for
visualizations of its data organized in digital shadows and models, and
the interaction with services of the digital twin, and thus
enabling humans to access, adapt and add information and
monitor and partially control the physical system.

A cockpit is, by definition, a part of the digital twin, and  can be seen both
as a special service provided by the digital twin and an integrative front-end
component for various specific services that the digital twin provides.
A cockpit visualizes various forms of data, which includes, e.g., digital 
shadows, any form of data received from third-party systems, all kinds of data
and commands entered by the humans using the cockpit and models of the physical
system or the operation processes of the physical system.

A specific kind of a digital twin cockpits is a
**Process-Aware Digital Twin Cockpit (PADTC)** [[BMRW22]](#BMRW22).  

* A PADTC is a
digital twin cockpit that additionally provides functionality to handle 
explicated processes of the 
physical object and its' context.


A PADTC is a digital twin cockpit but has a stronger focus on processes, which
are explicitly defined using appropriate process definition languages.
A PADTC knows the allowed processes (in the form of models), the current status
of these processes (in the form of status data), and
the history of these processes states and executed actions (in the forms of 
data lakes).
Processes describe the steps needed to be carried out by (1) the physical 
object, (2) the digital twin, or (3) are expected to be executed by the 
context, which includes humans and other physical objects respectively their 
digital twins.
A process may have several active participants, but not all of those need to be 
participating in each process definition, which allows various forms of 
automation of processes. Thus, a process step is executed automatically by the 
physical object, the digital twin (only), which means it is a form of data 
processing. In addition, it is executed by physical objects in the context,
is executed by humans involved, or
is executed by humans involved using the physical object.

Besides these foundations of digital twins, we have further investigated 
which DSLs are relevant for the Engineering of Digital Twins,
self-adaptive digital twin architectures [[BBD+21a]](#BBD+21a),
how to use 
[Generative Software Engineering](/research/Generative-SE) for 
creating digital twin architectures [[BDH+20]](#BDH+20),
how to derive digital twin cockpits [[DMR+20]](#DMR+20) from models using 
the [MontiGem](/research/MontiGem) generator, and
how to use process prediction within digital twins [[BHK21]](#BHK21). 
Other research focuses on the creation of
low-code platforms for model-driven digital twins [[DHM+22]](#DHM+22) or
sustainable digital twin engineering for the production domain.
Within our research, 

To realize digital twins and their cockpits is an increasingly complex task
that leads us to the idea of increasing the degree of automation for
creating them. Within [[BMR+22]](#BMR+22), we have presented a
low-code development approach
that reduces the amount of hand-written code needed and uses
process mining techniques to derive PADTCs.

Within [[MPRW22]](#MPRW22), we are discussing integration challenges
for digital twin systems-of-systems such as the hoizontal integration of
digital twin parts, the composition of DTs for different perspectives, or
how to handle different lifecycle representations of the original system.
