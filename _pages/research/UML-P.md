## Summary of Most Relevant Topic Papers

The **UML/P** [[Rum16]](#Rum16) [[Rum17]](#Rum17) [[Rum12]](#Rum12) 
[[Rum11]](#Rum11) is a realization [[Sch12]](#Sch12)
of a subset of the modeling languages of the [UML](/research/Unified-Modeling-Language) with
particular focus on applicability for programming, i.e., modeling of
software systems (the "P" in UML/P stands for "suitable for
programming"). It comprises the following types of UML diagrams:


* **Class Diagrams** as basic structural modeling technique
      with solid yet configurable semantics [[MRR11f]](#MRR11f) [[MRR11e]](#MRR11e),
* **Object Diagrams** to describe specific situations that
      are used for setups of tests or test verdicts as well as
      unwanted situations, etc. [[MRR11c]](#MRR11c).
* **Statecharts** are the main technique to describe
      behavior. UML/P Statecharts can be used as abstract
      specifications, explicitly allowing underspecification in
      various forms as well as code-like detailed algorithms, where a
      direct mapping to code becomes feasible. UML/P Statecharts
      assist the large bandwidth between high-level abstract
      specifications and implementations and come with a powerful
      refinement calculus allowing for the refinement of specifications
      throughout the development process as well as from superclasses
      to specific implementations in subclasses.
* **Sequence Diagrams** describe interactions between
      objects in a specific situation and thus are generally
      exemplary. They can be used nicely for describing the
      set up and the execution of tests.
* **OCL** is a textual language in the spirit of predicate
      logic over object models, allowing to describe constraints of
      various forms. OCL/P is a specific variant of OCL that allows for
      writing constraints in a syntax inspired by Java [[GJS05]](#GJS05). It
      is extended by various techniques for set and list comprehension
      known from functional languages like Haskell [[HJW92]](#HJW92).

These languages can be used individually as well as in a coherent
language family that allows to connect models of different sublanguages
into a well structured, accessible specification of complex systems.

This constitutes a powerful way of describing software systems on
various levels of abstraction from different viewpoints. In addition,
it is possible to use Java expressions to enrich the models with
implementation details. As such, UML/P forms the foundation for
applied [Generative Software 
Engineering](/research/Generative-SE).

To shape UML/P as a modular, composable set of languages, we have
intensively applied the techniques of 
[Software Language Engineering (SLE)](/research/Language-Engineering). 
As an example, OCL is not only a stand-alone constraint
language, but it is also used for pre- and post-conditions in
Statechart transitions, for state invariants, for desired properties to
describe the verdict of tests, and for desired properties while inside a
sequence diagram-governed test execution.

For the constructive part of UML/P Java expressions are also integrated
in various UML/P sublanguages. This integration relies on solid
foundations, actually allowing for intensive consistency checks within
models of all sublanguages as indicated in the figure below.
This includes type checking of variables introduced and used in
sublanguages as well as the mapping of symbols defined in one
sublanguage to another sublanguage.

Because object diagrams have limited expressiveness on their own, we
have integrated object diagrams into OCL/P to identify specific
scenarios via diagrams and connecting them with powerful logic operators
of OCL/P. The integration of object diagrams into OCL/P allows for
describing the context of invariants and specifying situations that are
allowed, forbidden, or alternatives. This yields a powerful yet
partially diagrammatic logic specification technique.

We also have dealt with activity diagrams [[MRR11d]](#MRR11d) [[MRR11a]](#MRR11a) as
extension of the UML/P and the ADL [MontiArc](/research/Software-Architecture) 
completes UML/P with a notation for logically
or physically distributed computation [[BKRW17a]](#BKRW17a).

Parts of UML/P are available from the [**MontiCore** Website](http://monticore.de/)
as an Eclipse plugin featuring syntax-aware
editors for the various types of diagrams. We have successfully applied
UML/P for generatively creating various kinds of software systems. This
spans from database schemas over web applications up to entire data
management desktop applications.
UML/P is under continuous extension with interesting new features.

Below we provide a selection of relevant publications about the UML/P as well as 
related interesting topics. Please also note the [MontiCore 
Website](http://monticore.de/) for details on the technology as well as access 
to the UML/P itself.
