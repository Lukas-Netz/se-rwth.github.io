The Software Engineering group concentrates on innovative and practically useful concepts, methods, and tools for the development of complex business and software-intensive embedded systems on a sound and reliable scientific and engineering basis. In the current age of digitalisation it is important to develop at high speed and deliver good quality.

In recent years, software engineering has significantly extended and consolidated its portfolio of methods, techniques, and tools to support development of highly critical, reliable, or functionally complex systems within the predefined time and a given budget while meeting the required quality [[BEP+00]](https://www.se-rwth.de/research). It is our mission to transfer this knowledge and the accompanying tools into industry as well as to customize and apply them to project and company specific needs.
