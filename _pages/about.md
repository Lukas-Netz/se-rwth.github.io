The Software Engineering group, led by Bernhard Rumpe, 
concentrates on innovative and practically 
useful concepts, methods, and tools for the development of complex 
business and software-intensive embedded systems on a sound and reliable 
scientific and engineering basis. In the current age of digitalisation it 
is important to develop at high speed and deliver good quality.

In recent years, software engineering has significantly extended and 
consolidated its portfolio of methods, techniques, and tools to support 
development of highly critical, reliable, or functionally complex systems 
within the predefined time and a given budget while meeting the required 
quality [[BEP+00]](/topics). It is our mission to 
transfer this knowledge and the accompanying tools into industry as well 
as to customize and apply them to project and company specific needs.

#### Our Mission
<blockquote>
   To define, improve and industrially apply <em>techniques</em>, <em>concepts</em>, and <em>methods</em> for innovative and <em>efficient development</em> of software and software-intensive systems, such that <em>high-quality</em> products can be developed in a <em>shorter period of time</em> and with flexible integration of <em>changing requirements</em>.

Our recent collaborators are BMW, the RTL/VOX TV sender group, FEV, Metro Cash Systems, Senacor, Adesso, DSA, Volkswagen, Daimler, Streetscooter, QSC, RegioIT, Siemens, and many others. Our work is organized within the following teams which are though conceptually related.
- **Automotive and Cyber-Physical Systems (ASE)**
- **Model-Based Assistance and Information Services (MBAIS)**
- **Model-Driven Systems Engineering (MDSE)**
- **Modeling Language Engineering (MLE)**

Within research and industrial projects we are developing new methods, concepts, and tools for software engineering in general, for specific software systems, and also specific application domains where digitalisation is currently an issue. Working in this manner allows existing concepts and tools to be applied, evaluated, elaborated, and adapted within specific areas independently, and then to generalize and transfer them into the other working areas. For further information about our research topics applied and developed in the teams, please refer to [our publications and research](/topics).
