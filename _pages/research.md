**Our research mission**:
Improving software and systems development by identifying: 
* **methods, concepts, tools** 
  and **infrastructures** for 
* **innovative** and 
  **efficient** 
  **incremental** development 
* of software and software intensive 
  **high quality systems** 
* in **less time** while 
* **flexibly integrating evolving 
  requirements**.

We use **model-based development of software** (model-based software 
engineering, MBSE), **generative and synthesis techniques**, and 
model-driven digitalisation of system development.

During our scientific endeavour we contributed a number of 
[publications](http://www.se-rwth.de/publications) to this mission and 
the overall approach has successfully evaluated in various industrial 
projects in the areas of embedded systems, artificial intelligence, 
autonomous vehicles, IoT, smart buildings, energy, robotics, and cloud 
systems, but also in administration, e.g. leveraging on the model based 
formalization of contracts, laws, and standards. 

Our **language workbench MontiCore** 
[[HKR21]](https://monticore.de/handbook.pdf), is a key framework for 
creating and processing **domain-specific languages**. It has 
successfully been used to demonstrate that code generation increases 
software quality and developer efficiency. This means, MBSE enables and 
improves agile development. 

Projects include requirements elicitation, as well as cyber-physical 
function, version, and variant modeling. All this is based on a sound 
theoretical knowledge of modeling languages and their semantics and our 
ability to leverage this in industrial practice. 

Below we have collected and grouped especially interesting publications 
around our  main research topics, application domains, and tools. Each 
topic page describes our contributions to this topic in a 
consolidated, compact form.

## Upcoming Research Topics

Fresh research topics not necessarily already come with published 
articles. We assume results will be published in the near future:

- SysML 2.0
- Modelling in Production 
  (fitting to the RWTH Internet of Production Excellence Cluster, IOP)
