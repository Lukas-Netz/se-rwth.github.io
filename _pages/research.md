We are interested in quite a number of foundational and applied topics. 
Below we have collected especially interesting publications around our 
main research topics, application domains, and tools. Each topic page 
describes the our contributions to this topic in a consolidated, 
compact form.

## Current and Fresh Research Topics

Fresh research topics not necessarily already come with published 
articles. We assume results will be published soon:

- Digital Twins and Digital Shadows in Engineering and Production
- SysML 2.0
- Modelling in Production (fitting to the RWTH Internet of Production Excellence 
Cluster, IOP)
