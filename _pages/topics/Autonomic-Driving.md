## Summary of Most Relevant Topic Papers
From the viewpoint of software engineering, **intelligent driver assistance** 
and, in particular, **autonomous driving** is an interesting and demanding 
challenge, because it includes the development of complex software embedded 
within a distributed, life-critical system (car) and the connection of 
heterogeneous, autonomous mobile devices (other cars, infrastructure, etc.) into 
one, large, distributed system. Therefore, we are involved in a number of 
projects with major European car manufacturers in which we transfer modern 
software development techniques to the car domain. This transfer is necessary 
as, with its increasing complexity, software becomes a demanding driver of the 
overall systems development process and not just an add-on.

In the **Carolo project**, we built **Caroline** 
[[R+10]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Caroline-An-Autonomously-Driving-Vehicle-for-Urban-Environments.pdf) 
- a completely autonomous car - and participated in the [Darpa Urban 
Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/), where our car was driving 
autonomously in an urban area for hours. We successfully achieved the best place 
as newcomers (and best non-Americans). This resulted from a number of facts, 
including the rigorous application of **agile development methods**, such as XP 
and Scrum and a simulation for driving scenarios. In 
[[BR12]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Engineering-Autonomous-Driving-Software.pdf) 
we describe the process driven by story cards as a form of use cases, a 
continuously integrated and running software up to a rigorous test, and 
simulation infrastructure, called Hesperia.

In particular, we have developed a **rigorous test infrastructure** for 
intelligent, sensor-based functions through **fully-automatic simulation** (not 
only visualization!) of the car within its surrounding: the city, pedestrians 
and especially other cars 
[[BBR07]](https://www.se-rwth.de/topics/~rumpe/publications20042008/Software-and-Systems-Engineering-Process-and-Tools-for-the-Development-of-Autonomous-Driving-Intelligence.pdf). 
Our simulator is capable of running automatic back-to-back tests on the complete 
software system with no real hardware involved by producing sensoric input from 
the simulation and acting according to the steering output of the autonomous 
driving software. Every night and, when necessary for every version change, the 
tests are automatically executed.

This technique allows us a **dramatic speedup in development and evolution** of 
autonomous car functionality, and thus, enables us to develop software in an 
agile way 
[[BR12b]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Autonomous-Driving-5-Years-after-the-Urban-Challenge-The-Anticipatory-Vehicle-as-a-Cyber-Physical-System.pdf). 
We have successfully shown that agile development of high-quality software is 
possible and very effective in the automotive domain. However, it remains a 
challenge to combine this innovative modern way of agile, iterative systems 
development with the current development standards, such as ISO 26262, in order 
to allow the OEMs to benefit both from efficiency and quality on one hand and 
legal issues on the other hand.

In newer projects, we have **evaluated and designed OEM specific architectures 
and processes**, on individual assistance functions and on the complete 
architecture. 
[[BBH+13]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Meta-Metrics-for-Simulations-in-Software-Engineering-on-the-Example-of-Integral-Safety-Systems.pdf) 
contains metrics, e.g., to understand the cross-linkage complexity for software 
and functions.

In 
[[MMR10]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Evolving-Software-Architecture-Descriptions-of-Critical-Systems.pdf) 
we give an overview of the current state-of-the-art in development and evolution 
on a more general level by considering any kind of critical system that relies 
on architectural descriptions.

As tooling infrastructure, we mainly used an IDE such as Eclipse and in 
particular the SSElab storage, versioning and management services 
[[HKR12]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/SSELab-A-Plug-In-Based-Framework-for-Web-Based-Project-Portals.pdf). 
Without those agile development would not have been possible.

## Key Statements
1. Automatic, repeatable tests speed up the development process.
2. Testing of sensor-based functions works best by simulating the sensoric input 
on realistic scenarios.
3. Intelligent driver assistance is tested best by simulating full urban 
scenarios, which is not that complicated.
4. Software-intensive functions in embedded domains can be developed using agile 
methods.
