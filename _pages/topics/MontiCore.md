## Summary of Most Relevant Topic Papers

[MontiCore](http://monticore.de/) is a language workbench for the 
efficient development of domain-specific languages. 
[MontiCore](http://monticore.de/) is used as a basic vehicle for our 
ongoing research in the area of model-based software engineering. The 
[MontiCore Language Workbench and Library Handbook 
[HKR21]](http://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf) features **agile and 
compositional** development of **domain-specific (modeling) languages 
(DSLs)**. These concepts have the potential to greatly impact the 
software engineering process by enabling easy development of 
high-quality, custom-tailored languages to express software models. 
Such models can be analyzed, interpreted, and, in the end, potentially 
transformed into a running software product. 

The MontiCore framework provides necessary application programming 
interfaces along with a special language definition format based on 
grammars. 

MontiCore has been realized particularly with respect to **modularity** 
both concerning the implementation and the development of DSLs. As 
such, DSLs can be realized in a **compositional** way, **reusing**, for 
example, common language definitions. This allows the creation of 
**language libraries** which make it even easier to create the desired 
DSL. Modularity and compositionality of MontiCore's language component 
is based on (1) compositional concrete and abstract syntax, (2) 
compositional definition of context conditions, (3) clear definition of 
model interfaces using symbols of various symbol kinds (far beyond any 
restrictions of programming languages), and (4) compositional analysis 
and generation infrastructure enabling black-box reuse of algorithms on 
sub-languages. 

Therefore, MontiCore comes with a large library of **language 
components** containing various forms of expressions, statements, and 
literals. A second level of language components defines constituents 
for modeling languages, such as **StateCharts, Class Diagrams, Object 
Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, BDDs and IBDs** from **UML** and **SysML** 
as well as **Feature Diagrams**, etc. The library of **language 
components** also provides possibilities to specify in first-order 
logic (i.e., an extension of the **OCL**), with specific emphasis on 
sets, physical units (**SI units**), both as literals and as types 
including automatic conversions. It provides **regular expressions** as 
language elements defining subtypes for strings providing typesafe 
processing of strings beyond standard programming language 
capabilities. Each of the provided language components comes with 
locally defined symbol kinds that can be exported and mapped to symbol 
kinds of other languages. 

MontiCore has successfully been deployed in a variety of industrial and 
research projects. Among many other general and domain-specific 
languages, the [UML/P family of modeling languages](/topics/UML-P) has 
been realized with MontiCore, and various forms of structured text 
languages for requirements, norms, and even legal texts were defined. 

Based on the facilities the MontiCore Language Workbench provides, 
**automatic derivation** of a **transformation language** for a given 
modeling language, **variability** of the languages, adding **tagging** 
to a given language, or even smart **analysis** techniques, such as 
**semantic differences** have been constructed and successfully 
realized. Below we provide a selection of relevant publications about 
MontiCore and related topics that are based on the MontiCore framework.
